Dear Madam and Sir,

We are a team based at the French national museum of natural history and we are working on the project Galaxy-E (https://github.com/65MO/Galaxy-E). This project aims to develop an instance of the data analysis web platform Galaxy focused on the analysis of ecological data.
The main objectives that drive us are : the improvement of reproducibility, collaboration and training in ecological data analysis.
We are using the Galaxy training material framework to design tutorials associated with the tools we integrate in Galaxy-E.
Yvan Le Bras has already contacted the ALA, the Nectar, and the ANDS, he also exchanged email with Simon Gladman about the usegalaxy.au project.
We think that a collaboration could be very interesting.
Best regards,

Simon
