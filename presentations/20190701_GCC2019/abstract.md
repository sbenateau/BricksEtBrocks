The Galaxy-Bricks project aims to fill a gap in our citizen science programs. Historically the citizen science programs developed by the French National Museum of Natural History were focusing on data collection. In the last decade they have broaden their scope and education became a major component of these programs. Education to scientific approach in the context of citizen science is extremely promising. The participants follow the protocols and develop a knowledge or even an expertise in the field they are contributing to (e.g. species identification). The data collected allows research teams to perform data analyses on large datasets.
To increase the possibilities and extend collaborations between research teams and participants, we are developing Galaxy-Bricks, a data analysis tool based on Galaxy for ecology. This plateform should inclued user-friendly tools together with specific training material, designed for a non-professional contributors.
For students this approach gives the possibility to have a context to work interdisciplinary on natural science, data science and mathematics and gives a chance to 

through the use of Galaxy-E (Galaxy for ecology) collaboration

Citizen science contributors provide a large amount of data, which are historically analyzed by research teams.
As our department works on citizen science, we are trying to develop new ways to interact with the contributors.
